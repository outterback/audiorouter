# audiorouter

This is a VST 2 plugin created to circumvent Ableton Lives audio routing capabilities.

The plugin exposes three inputs, and three outputs, each with their own gain control, and enables an Ableton Live
user to route audio into the any position of any audio chain, as long as you can put a VST audio effect there.
